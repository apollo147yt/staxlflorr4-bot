    This project is taking a while.
    This project is heavily inspired by the Flowr bot made by peterpeterp on discord
    We have encounted so many bugs (and still are)
    if you have any suggestions with the code please make some :)
    this was a small project between us, starting off as a complete joke but seems to be coming together
    DM us on discord if you have any questions of improvements for the bot
    <span style="color:#0000FF"> DISCORD:</span>
    (This Bot is still being developed, there may [will] be bugs. If you find any please dm us using the discord usernames above)
    Enjoy the bot :) (or don't whatever)

    make sure you are using python (I dont know how many of you are brain dead so I had to put this here)

    to start copy the code down or download it whatever you prefer

    In terms of adding this bot to your own server replace the "your-bot-token" at the bottom of the code, with your bot token. in the "!spin" command change the line: 
    "if ctx.channel.name != 'spin':
        await ctx.send("This command can only be used in the #spin channel.")
        return" 
    replace the "spin" with the channel name you want the bot to be used in or delete it entirely depending on how you want to use this bot

    Im not entirely sure if you need to use any terminal commands if anyone finds any that are needed dm us so we can make this bot more easily accessible :)

    There aint much else (or at least I think)
    dm us if things are missing
