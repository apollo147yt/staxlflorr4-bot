## Just some information
This bot is taking a while.
This project started of as a complete joke and has turned into something decent.

## Instructions for setup
Use python. (This bot is written in python. To edit the code use a code editor such as VScode).
to start copy the code down or download it whatever you prefer.
In terms of adding this bot to your own server replace the "your-bot-token" at the bottom of the code, with your bot token. in the "!spin" command change the line:

```
    "if ctx.channel.name != 'spin':
        await ctx.send("This command can only be used in the #spin channel.")
        return" 
```

replace the "spin" with the channel name you want the bot to be used in or delete it entirely depending on how you want to use this bot.

*Optional*

If you would like to make your own bot and pair the code with it you have to use the [discord devoloper portal](https://discord.com/developers).
