    This project is taking a while.
    This project is heavily inspired by the Flowr bot made by peterpeterp on discord
    We have encounted so many bugs (and still are)
    if you have any suggestions with the code please make some :)
    this was a small project between us, starting off as a complete joke but seems to be coming together
    DM us on discord if you have any questions of improvements for the bot
    $${\color{blue}DISCORD: \space \color{red}apollo147 \space \color{lightblue}and \space \colour{red}staxlflorr}$$
    (This Bot is still being developed, there may [will] be bugs. If you find any please dm us using the discord usernames above)
    Enjoy the bot :) (or don't whatever)

    In terms of adding this bot to your own server replace the "your-bot-token" at the bottom of the code, with your bot token. in the     "!spin" command change the line: 
    "if ctx.channel.name != 'spin':
        await ctx.send("This command can only be used in the #spin channel.")
        return" 
    replace the "spin" with the channel name you want the bot to be used in or delete it entirely depending on how you want to use         this bot

    There aint much else (or at least I think)
    dm me if things are missing
