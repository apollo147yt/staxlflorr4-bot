## Just some information
This bot is taking a while.
This project started of as a complete joke and has turned into something decent.

## Instructions for setup
Use python
In terms of adding this bot to your own server replace the "your-bot-token" at the bottom of the code, with your bot token. in the "!spin" command change the line: 
    "if ctx.channel.name != 'spin':
        await ctx.send("This command can only be used in the #spin channel.")
        return" 
    replace the "spin" with the channel name you want the bot to be used in or delete it entirely depending on how you want to use this bot
To make the bot you have to use the [discord devoloper portal](https://discord.com/developers).
